## ### Some technical bits

  

Find much more in-depth technical description in the dexterity [whitepaper](https://hxronetwork.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/QmQTfVoV13wRk2tQqhjTHVNXEZZRtEoH1HLVV64S1g51UZ), for the purposes of connecting it's important to understand two fundamental concepts in dexterity, that of the market product group and trader risk group.

- The market product group (MPG) represents a selection of actively traded products where cross-margining can take place.

- Products are dynamic in the sense that some products in a group will expire and new ones will get created, obviously some like a perpetual future can exist in perpetuity. The MPG is generally created and maintained by the network.

- The trader risk group (TRG) represents the trader's deposits, orders, positions and overall risk in the instruments of a specific MPG. This should be created by the trader as it will be linked to the trader's wallet.
